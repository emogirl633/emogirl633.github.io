      <p><center>this one’s easy. i refuse to hold myself accountable for the person in the mirror every-time i look at it, excessive finger gunning and all. let a gaggle of 8th grade bullies ask me the million dollar question of “do you know this loser?” the answer is no. absolutely not. kick her ass, big child named butch! i'll even coach you! stab her in the eyes with the wheat between your teeth! cue me up, i'll do it myself. and you! guys from that movie! you know, the one where they are men and wear black! you've got nothing on me! hit me with your finger print eraser! you'd be doing me a favor!</center></p>
      <p><center>or maybe they wouldn't be. you see, i don't want to seize to exist and all that mumbo jumbo. i know it'd be absolutely crazy and unexpected for <b>me</b> to proclaim something super, i don't know, <b>emo</b> or something but i'm actually okay with filling out the census every ten years. it's more about pretending i didn't do half the embarrassing stuff i have done in my 18 years of walking around this planet (or, really, a couple municipalities within it) and here's the story of how i did just that. is embarrassment subjective? sure. so consider me the subject.
        <p><center>about three years ago i was at a party. i had just gotten my braces off a couple months prior so naturally i thought i was turning over a new leaf. here i was, 15 and with no metal in my mouth. i could take over the entire world if i wanted to, so of course my first order of business was to go to a party. in some random person's parent's backyard. obviously.</center></p>
        <p><center> it was my first party as a sophomore and i was a little rusty on the process since i was coming off of the high of being a total badass freshman year. i had spent the prior school year <i>totally voluntarily</i> renouncing going out on weekends. i listened to strictly club music from the early 2000's. i sat alone at lunch on a-days to stick it to the man. the whole year drugs walked right up to me, got on their knees, and practically <i>begged</i> me to take them, and i still said no.</center></p>
        <p><center>by the time this party rolled around though, i had new lifestyle and new friends. sometime in late 2018 a new neighbor of mine made sure he befriended me the first week he moved in. he came from a really big family that always lived in suburban neighborhoods and knew everyone around the bend, so my building was his worst nightmare. all we had were seasonal tenants leaching off the beach while hell (or really just Canada) froze over and an incomprehensible amount of middle aged real estate agents. having realized there was only one other person his age in the entire place he decided to make the best of it. he stuck around for a year or so, until he got his family's lease broken for smoking pot inside all the time. he also introduced me to some kid he was friends with that watched regular show with me and ate all my snacks, and a girl who only came around to take us to <a href="page4.html">work</a>. on my end, i introduced all of them to a friend of mine that I had met at the park a few years prior and his lady friend (a union that dissipated within a week of everyone meeting each other, but she still hung out with us before she went off to college... and thereafter.) as for me, i started listening to third eye blind and discovered mascara.</center></p>
        <p><center>i will cite this party as <a href="page3.html">the party that changed my life</a>: i realized parties are kind of lame.</center></p>
        <p><center>to keep things concise (at least in this part of the story) i ended up encountering the biggest menace to my teenage self while waiting to leave the party... the guy in my human geography class. the guy i had a crush on the previous school year, and one i never bothered actually talking to. here he was though, skateboard in hand and ready to put me into cardiac arrest. (that's right. a <i>skateboard</i>. so embarrassing. i liked someone just because of their preferred mode of transportation. i have gotten a <b><i>grip</i></b> since then thankfully.) to make matters worse my friend, who he had just gotten there with, went inside and LEFT Human Geography Guy there with me. the obligatory conversation that ensued wasn't necessarily the worst conversation on earth, at least up until he recognized me. sort of. he asked me if i had a sister. confused, i said that i didn't and asked why he asked. that's when he said it. what i probably dreamed about the entire year before. he recognized me. that's it! plan the wedding! in between choosing between hydrengas and lilies for our summer wedding however he kept talking... and said i couldn't be who he was thinking about... that that girl never knew what was going on in class. a statement i know he made because he really thought i was someone else. i didn't have the foresight at the time but upon contemplation i can understand why he may have been confused. i no longer had braces, my mom had forced me to get keratin for my hair a week before, i had thinned out my eyebrows over the summer because of how much my friends made fun of how thick they were, and i had lost some weight because of my growing eating disorder. that's not to say i was <i>hot</i> or anything out of a raunchy 90's flick. i just looked different. now, this is where someone would probably tell him that that was me and laugh off the encounter. but then i started thinking about how stupid i probably seemed in class and the embarrassing stuff i probably did without knowing it. so i said it must've been someone else. i quite literally <b>denied knowing myself</b>. and i'd do it again.</center></p>

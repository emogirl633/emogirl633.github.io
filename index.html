		   <p><center>i know it's quite grandiose to assume anyone kept the porch light on for me to come back. sure, maybe you would've-- if there WAS a "you." would you believe this site gets no traffic? i'd assume a typical 4pm jam at the least, if not for the fact it's completely dormant. it wouldn't be <i>my</i> blog if it wasn't! at least u don't have to worry about an imposter running this thing. one less thing to worry about!</center></p> 
			   <p><center>the truth is, if it wasn't for a text alert from my bank i wouldn't be writing any of this. per my account's overdraft, it seemed i had this domain another year... i need to make VERY clear that i never forgot about it once this past year. i think it's criminal how much i <i>did</i> think about it since it remained just as obsolete after every passing thought. honestly, blame my lack of creativity. plus, according to wordaday.com, my favorite latent email subscription from yesteryear, my vocabulary is meek at best. what business would i have blogging if i can't even use fetching in a sentence? then there's the whole set up of this thing in the form of my old friend html. he and i do not speak the same language.</center></p>

			<p><center>forgiving and forgetting: easy. unless it’s myself.</center></p>
			<p><center>i don’t even think that an out of body version of myself knocking on my door apologetically with a box of chocolates in one hand and Final Destination 3 Director's Cut in the other would facilitate the process. one single mistake of mine kicks off <a href="page2.html"> the five stages of grief.</a> suffice to say, i'm constantly mourning myself.</center></p>

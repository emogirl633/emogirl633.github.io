<img width="150" height=150 src="me.jpg" /> <br/> </h4> i had a blog before this one on blogger, which i had made because i was frustrated by the fact i couldn't <i> possibly </i> understand how to create my own html. my first post on there was actually about that, you could check it out <a href="https://emogirl633.blogspot.com/2021/03/my-geeky-friend-ate-my-golf-club.html" target="_blank"> here. </a> </h4>
<p><h4>turns out i could manage somewhat! i even got to do it without any communication with Frank Van Der Post! the mystery of his eyes or lacktherof prevails. on top of that, another question remains: does this mean <i> i'm </i> the geeky smart friend?</h4></p>
